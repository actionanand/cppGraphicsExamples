# C++ : Graphics Examples

It(graphics.h) is called BGI(Borland Graphics Interface).It is an olden 32-bit real-mode DOS library, included with Borland's Turbo C and C++ products. And basically graphics.h, conio.h can be inferred as windows headerfiles. So It'll run only one windows.

The last [Borland's C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Graphics_Interface) IDE for DOS is Borland C++ 3.1 (1992). The last C++ environment which supports BGI is Borland C++ 5.02 (1997), which works under Windows but can compile DOS programs. BGI was accessible in C/C++ with graphics.lib / graphics.h, and in Pascal via the graph unit.

BGI was less powerful than modern graphics libraries such as SDL or OpenGL, since it was designed for 2D presentation graphics instead of event-based 3D applications. However, it has been considered simpler to code. BGI and Turbo C++, although obsolete, are still widely used in education in India.

> This repo is for practising C++ graphics (turbo c++) using `graphics.h` file.

10. Test program

```cpp
#include<graphics.h>

main(){
  initwindow(800, 800);
  //  creating line
  //  line(200, 210, 400, 410);

## Instaructions for code blocks

1. Download `codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup` (64 bit) from [here](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/).

   - [游리v20.03 mingw 64-bit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe), [游리v20.03 mingw 32-bit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/codeblocks-20.03mingw-32bit-setup.exe), [游리v17.12 mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/17.12/Windows/codeblocks-17.12mingw-setup.exe/download), [游리v16.01 mingw](http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/16.01/Windows/codeblocks-16.01mingw-setup.exe)
