# Sine Cos Waves & Tan Graph

## C program to draw sine wave using graphics

In this program we first initialize graphics mode, by passing graphics driver(DETECT), default graphics mode and specifies the directory path where initgraph looks for graphics drivers (*.BGI). Then we will draw a horizontal axis using line representing the angle in radians. Inside a for loop we calculate the value of cosine for an angle and color the specific pixel using putpixel function. At last we increment the angle by 5.

## C program to draw tan graph using graphics

In this program, we first initialize graphics mode, by passing graphics driver(DETECT), default graphics mode and specifies the directory path where initgraph looks for graphics drivers (*.BGI). Then we will draw a horizontal axis using line function representing the angle in radians. Inside a for loop we calculate the value of tangent for an angle and color the specific pixel using putpixel function. At last we increment the angle by 2.
